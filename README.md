## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Flutter**: A framework for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

- **.NET Core SDK**: A cross-platform framework for building modern, cloud-based, and internet-connected applications.

- **Firebase Account**: A platform for building and managing mobile and web applications.

- **Foursquare Developer Account**: Access to Foursquare's APIs for location-based services.

## Setting Up the Project

Follow these steps to set up and run the OpcloApp project:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the OpcloApp repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UsmanAsad87/OpcloApp.git
```

### 2. Set Up Firebase

OpcloApp utilizes Firebase for backend services. To configure Firebase:

- **Create a Firebase Project**: Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.

- **Configure Firebase for Flutter**: Follow the [official documentation](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/overview) to add Firebase to your Flutter project.

- **Update Firebase Configuration**: Download the `google-services.json` (for Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (for iOS) from the Firebase Console and place them in the respective directories of your Flutter project.

### 3. Set Up Foursquare API

OpcloApp uses the Foursquare API for location-based services. To set it up:

- **Create a Foursquare Developer Account**: Sign up at the [Foursquare Developer Portal](https://location.foursquare.com/developer/).

- **Create an Application**: In the developer portal, create a new application to obtain your API keys.

- **Integrate Foursquare API**: Use the obtained API keys to integrate Foursquare's Places API into your Flutter application. ([docs.foursquare.com](https://docs.foursquare.com/developer/reference/foursquare-apis-overview))

### 4. Run the Flutter Application

With the backend running, you can now run the Flutter application:

- **Install Flutter**: If you haven't already, install [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) on your machine.

- **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the Flutter project directory and install the necessary packages:

  ```bash
  cd OpcloApp/Flutter
  flutter pub get
  ```

- **Run the Application**: Start the application on your desired device:

  ```bash
  flutter run
  ```
